# 🎄 Welcome to Precis' Advent of Code 2023 Repository! 🎄

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an annual series of Christmas-themed programming puzzles covering a wide array of challenges that can be solved using any programming language you prefer. For more information, check out [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## How to Participate in This Repository
1. **Create Your Own Wonderland**: Make a folder with your name or username in this repository. This will be your personal winter wonderland where you'll store your solutions.
   
2. **Daily Gifts of Code**: For each day of Advent, add your solution to your folder. Name the files descriptively, something like `Day1.py`, `Day2.java`, or `Day3.rs`, depending on your language of choice.

3. **Spread the Christmas Cheer**: Feel free to look around other folders. If you see someone stuck or if you have suggestions, don't hesitate to create an issue or a pull request. Remember, this is a season of giving!

4. **Stay Jolly and Keep It Fun**: Keep in mind, this is all about having fun and improving your coding skills. So, don't stress too much about finding the perfect solution. Enjoy the process and learn along the way!

## Code of Conduct
- **Be Respectful and Inclusive**: Remember to be kind and respectful to others. This is a community event and everyone is here to learn and have fun.
- **Share, Don't Plagiarize**: While it's okay to take inspiration from others, direct copying of someone else's work without credit is not cool. Let's keep the spirit of fairness and originality alive!

## Stay Connected
