# Advent of Code 2023

This project is a collaborative effort between the developer and GitHub Copilot

- **Language:** *Javascript*  
- **Engine:** *Node.js*
- Open `index.html` in `docs` for project documentation. Note: It's in progress and examples lack context.
- GitHub Copilot comments are guides, not definitive truths.

## Goals
- **Logging:** Enhance application visibility with detailed logs.
- **Unified Function:** Create a single function for tasks of parts 1 and 2.
- **Learning:** Use GitHub Copilot for learning JavaScript techniques and best practices.
- **Optimization:** Write initial functions and optimize with GitHub Copilot's suggestions.
- **Documentation:** Document functions using JSDoc.
- **Progress:** Aim to surpass previous year's AOC progress.
